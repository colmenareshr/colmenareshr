# Hi! I'm Humberto 👋
- Original version: [Spanish](../README.md)

I'm a Full Stack Developer, a bit self-taught and trained at [@toti-edu](https://github.com/toti-edu) in programming and web development. I am passionate about technology and making things work, paying attention to detail, following good practices and clean code. 

I love to research and I have good ability to find solutions to different challenges in this world of web development. 
  
## I hope to work as a 100% remote Full Stack developer.
Although I am open to possibilities, change and opportunities within a company, where I am in the pursuit of growing in my professional career. 

Currently I am still preparing to enter a work environment as a Full Stack and DevOps web developer in various online trainings in different institutions that offer technology training. 🙌
